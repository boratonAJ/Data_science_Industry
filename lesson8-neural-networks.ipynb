    "The last decade or so has seen an explosion in interest in neural networks, spurred on by huge successes that various neural network architectures have enjoyed across a number of classification tasks. This notebook shows how to use the Keras neural network library from within R to fit various kinds of neural networks. Keras is a high level library for specifying and training neural networks. It provides a relatively user-friendly way to interact with 3 powerful Python neural network libraries (`Theano`, `TensorFlow`, and `CNTK`) that provide efficient (low-level) tools for working with neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to get you up and running with Keras on a couple of \"normal\" prediction problems. In later notebooks we'll look at some extensions like tricks to boost performance and specific architectures - convolutional neural networks - that have are particularly useful for certain kinds of prediction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is meant to be read after going through three spreadsheet-based explanations of three core concepts in neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Layers**: Neural networks are alternating sequences of linear algebra (matrix multiplication) and non-linear transformations. Each pair of matrix multiplication and non-linear transformation of the result constitutes a layer of the network.\n",
    "2. **Backpropagation**: a way to train the weight parameters of a neural network, involving passing inputs \"forward\" through the network to get predictions and hence errors, and then passing these errors \"backwards\" through the network to adjust the parameters. This happens multiple times until some stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "3. **Stochastic gradient descent** (or other optimization algorithms): This specifies precisely how errors should be used to update the weights during the backwards pass of the backpropagation algorithm. \n",
