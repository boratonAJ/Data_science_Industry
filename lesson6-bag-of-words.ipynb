    "# Lesson 6 // Bag-of-words models\n",
    "\n",
    "In a bag-of-words model, a text document is represented by the set of words used in the document. This is a simplified representation that ignores much of the more subtle structure of text, like the order that words appear in and grammar. Frequency counts of the words used in a document can be used to cluster documents or as features in predictive modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we have a collection of newspaper articles drawn from entertainment and business categories. The set of documents is known as the *corpus*. The set of all unique words used in any of the articles consitutes our bag-of-words, also called the *vocabulary*. We can represent this data as a matrix, in which each article is a row, each word is a column, and the entry in row *i* and column *j* contains the number of times word *j* appears in document *i* (many of these values will be zero, so we have a sparse matrix). A final column contains our response variable, indicating the type of article (entertainment or business). We could use the word frequencies as features to build a model that, on the basis of frequencies of different words, predicts whether an article is about business or entertainment. This is a typical kind of use for a bag-of-words model. Some hypothetical data is shown below.\n",

    "3. Show how to test that model using in- and out-of-sample validation.\n",
    "4. Introduce *tf-idf* (term frequency-inverse-document-frequency), a way of weighting word frequencies that adjusts for how common a word is across documents (and hence how \"special\" a word is to a particular document).\n",

This is standard practice in text mining: we describe a document by the words that are contained in the document. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we decide what words are \"important\" to a document - by which we mean distinguish that document from another? One approach is to use word frequency. If a word like \"apple\" appears frequently in a document, it is more likely to be about a recipe or health than about politics, for example. However some words that appear frequently are *not* particularly useful: words like \"the\", \"a\", and so on. These are words that may appear frequently in a particular document, but are not interesting to us *because they also appear frequently in many other documents*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've previously encountered these as **stop words**, and we've typically removed them from the analysis to reveal more interesting underlying patterns. Another approach is, rather than removing the stop words, is to **downweight** them. This is what tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) does. Here \"term\" is just used as a general indicator of the unit of text we are interested in, like \"token\". Tf-idf is composed of two parts: \n",

    "\n",
    "Specifically, we are going to replace the term frequencies we were using before with new values called \"inverse document frequency weighted term frequencies\" or tf-idf for short.
