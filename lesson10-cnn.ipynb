    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) refer to a particular kind of neural network architecture that has proved enormously successful in dealing with data in which the input features exhibit some kind of spatial or temporal ordering. A surprisingly large number of data sets and applications fall into this category. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Images** display spatial ordering. We expect pixel values in nearby pixels to be similar, and if they are not similar this tells us something valuable (for example, that we have encountered an edge)\n",
    "- **Audio** or **acoustic** data displays temporal ordering. In music for example, the *sequence* of notes conveys important information. If you randomly reorder the notes in a symphony, you most likely end up with something that sounds very different, and very much worse, than the original. \n",
    "- **Text** data is also ordered \"temporally\", in the same way that audio is. We have seen that bag-of-words models can give good predictive results, but it would be no surprise to learn that better results can be obtained if we look at the order in which words are combined.\n",
    "- **Video** data is both spatially and temporally ordered: it is a collection of images ordered through time.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs are designed to exploit the structure of ordered data. Their fundamental building block is the *convolution filter*, a small matrix of coefficients or \"mask\" that is placed \"on top\" the ordered data and slid \"along\" the data in the direction given by the natural ordering. At each step, the coefficients in the convolution filter are multiplied with the data they are currently sitting on top of, and this multiplication can amplify or dampen the features in the data in a vast number of ways. This is the way CNNs extract \"meaning\" from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each layer in a CNN consists of a user-specified number of these convolution filters, plus some additional operations and transformations. The output of one layer forms the input to the next. In this way the convolution filters in one layer operate on the outputs of convolution filters in the previous layer. In practice, this means that convolution filters in early layers tend to detect very simple patterns (like edges in images) and later layers combine these patterns into something much more elaborate (the letter \"E\", or a face, for example). For this reason most CNNs are deep CNNs - they have several hidden layers between their input and output layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to fit CNNs to data in R. As in the previous lesson, there are two main goals: **understanding** what is going on in a CNN, which we'll do by looking at a spreadsheet example, and **implementing** CNNs on a larger scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the **keras** R package to implement CNNs, which provides an interface with the Python library of the same name. As mentioned in the last lesson, the \"main\" keras library is written in Python. What the R package **keras** does is to create (within R) a virtual Python environment, from which Python commands - specifically those used by (Python) keras - can be executed. You won't see this happening - from the perspective of the R user, the commands you enter are all R functions from the R **keras** package, and the results are returned in the form of R objects. But it does mean that you need to have Python installed, and have your version of R correctly detecting your Python installation, in order to do anything. This can be a mild-to-moderate pain, depending on your operating system and (in my case) how many different versions of Python you have managed to accumulate over the years. \n",
    "\n",
    "The good news (sort of) is that in this lesson we're not going to be using our own computers very much at all. CNNs, and most modern neural networks, are massive computation machines. As we saw in the previous lesson the operations they carry out are quite simple, but the sheer number of operations means that in most cases and for most people fitting neural networks on your own computer is not a practical option - they may take weeks or longer to run.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, *graphics processing units* or GPUs are excellent at doing just the kinds of computations used by neural networks. So right now most large-scale applications of neural networks use *GPU-accelerated computing* - a GPU is used in conjunction with a CPU and those computations that are most efficiently run on GPUs are farmed out to the GPU. Neural network libraries like Theano and Tensorflow do this for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people don't have access to their own GPUs, but there are a number of cloud computing options that provide access (at a cost!) to GPU-accelerated computing. In this notebook we will set up our own GPU-based cloud server using Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) service, part of the broader Amazon Web Services. This basically involves setting up an \"empty\" web server (or choosing from a number of default options), installing the software you need, and accessing the server as and when you need to run your analyses. AWS calls a server an \"instance\".\n",
    "\n",
    "> **WARNING!** Amazon EC2 has a number of different instance types, see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). Some instance types are free, but all the instance types using GPU computing **cost money**. Some costs are incurred for having an instance \"available\", even if it is not running. In my experience this is of the order of R5 per day per instance. Higher costs are incurred once you \"start\" an instance. The instance we will use is about \\$1 per hour . I cover costs in more detail below, but just a warning to **be careful** about how you use AWS. Most importantly, [set up a budget alert](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/free-tier-alarms.html) and **always [stop your instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html) running when you are done with it!**  \n",
