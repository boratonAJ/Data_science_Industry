This is a simple Shiny application which visualizes stock data downloaded from 
Google via the [quantmod](https://www.quantmod.com/) package. It illustrates the 
use of `shiny` inputs, outputs and reactives, and was inspired by [this RStudio tutorial](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson6/).
