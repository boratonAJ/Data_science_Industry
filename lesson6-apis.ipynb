    "In the last few notebooks we've been analyzing twitter data that was collected and collated for us. In this notebook we'll see how to gather Twitter data ourselves, using Twitter's APIs. In doing so we'll also learn the basics of gathering data more generally using APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API is an *Application Program Interface*, a way of accessing the functionality of a program from inside another program. APIs are software that act as intermediaries between two applications (in our context, a requester (you) and a website server). The API provides data in a standardized, efficient way, but first you need to know how to request things - APIs will differ in how this is done. You usually also need to get authorization to use the API beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "R has some packages for interacting with some of the most commonly used APIs like twitter, facebook, etc. The **httr** package is a more general way of making *http* requests to an API and can be used in cases where there's no specialist package (if there is, it'll often be easier to use that than **httr**).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notebook we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gather tweets and related data by searching against a sampling of recent tweets published in the past 7 days, using the **twitteR** package. The **twitteR** package provides an easy-to-use interface to the Twitter Search API.\n",
    "2. Gather tweets directly from the twitter stream (rather than a sample), using the **streamR** package. The **streamR** package provides an interface to the Twitter Streaming API.\n",
    "3. Show how you can do the same thing using the more general **httr** package, which is useful for cases where there is not a special purpose package for interacting with a particular API.\n"

    "## Accessing the Twitter Search API using twitteR\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter Search API is part of Twitterâ€™s REST API. It allows queries against the indices of recent or popular Tweets and behaves similarly to, but not exactly like the Search feature available in Twitter mobile or web clients, such as Twitter.com search. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Twitter Search API searches a sample of recent Tweets made in the last 7 days. When interpreting results its important to know that data collected in this way will not consist of *all* tweets (e.g. on a topic, by a user), just a sample of these. In other respects the Search API is similarly to using the search feature available on Twitter (e.g. see [Twitter.com](https://twitter.com/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on we will interface with Twitter Search API using **httr**. In this example, we're going to see how to interface with the API using the **twitteR** package. The results will be the same, and you could use either. The benefit of using **twitteR** is that it has been specifically designed of use with the Twitter Search API, and only that API, so it is a bit easier to use and you won't have to go wading through the API documentation. The **httr** package is more general, so it doesn't have e.g. functions that deal specifically with Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up a Twitter app\n",
    "\n",
    "Many APIs require you to authenticate with OAuth tokens. OAuth is an open standard for token-based authentication on the Internet. Essentially, the Twitter API allows you to access various parts of Twitter's data resources. To use the API, Twitter needs to know who you are, and OAuth is the standard way of doing this. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the Twitter API, authentication is done through creating your own Twitter Application, which is linked to your Twitter account. Twitter grants the authentication token to your app, but since this is linked to your account it gives Twitter a way of tracing the requests back to you. The fact that we are setting up an \"app\" is not important - from our point-of-view this app will not do anything, it is just a way to tell Twitter who we are when we make requests for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we're now going to set up our own Twitter app and get the authentication details. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following instructions are adapted from [here](http://thinktostart.com/twitter-authentification-with-r/).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to https://apps.twitter.com/ and log in with your Twitter Account (you need a Twitter account to do this). Click the \"Create new app\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enter the details of your app on the screen that follows:\n",
    "    + *Name*: this needs to be unique, so something like \"test\" won't be allowed, but other than that it doesn't matter what you call the app since you're the only person using it. \n",
    "    + *Description*: enter anything you want\n",
    "    + *Website*: Enter any valid URL as the website (I use `http://www.stats.uct.ac.za/`). \n",
    "    + *Callback URL*: this is the only important bit! Enter `http://127.0.0.1:1410`. \n",
    "    + Tick the box that says you agree with the conditions of use.\n",
    "    + Click the button that says \"Create your twitter application\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You now need to get and write down your authentication details. \n",
    "    + Select the \"Keys and Access Tokens\" tab, \n",
    "    + Copy and paste the Consumer key (API key) and Consumer secret (API secret)\n",
    "    + Click on \"Create my access token\" near the bottom of the page. Copy and paste the \"Access Token\" and \"Access Token Secret\". "

    "1. The **Quandl** package provides a way of accessing the [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/) API, which houses various kinds of financial and economic data. Many datasets are free, but if you would like to make more than 50 calls to the API a day, you need to create a free Quandl account and get an API key. You can have a look at the available datasets at https://docs.quandl.com/docs/data-organization. Data is brought into with R with the `Quandl()` `Quandl.datatable command()`, for time-series and data table objects respectively. See what data is available and in what format at the link above. Now, (a) create a Quandl account and get an API key, (b) find the `WIKI/PRICES` dataset and use the Quandl API to extract end of day stock prices for Apple and Microsoft for the period 1/1/2016 to 31/12/2016. Plot these two time series.\n",

    "2. Use the **httr** package to send a request to the Geolocation service of Google Maps JavaScript API that will give you the latitude-longitude co-ordinates of your home address.  The Geolocation service takes a street address (a string) and returns some data on that address (e.g. latitude and longitude). To find out what the form of the request should look consult the documentation [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start)).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the **httr** package and consult the [documentation](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search) on how to extract the followers of a user from the Twitter Search API. Extract the followers for a user of your choice and plot a histogram of the locations of these followers. "
