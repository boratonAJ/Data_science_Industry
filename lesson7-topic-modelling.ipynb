    "Topic modelling is a type of bag-of-words model that aims to summarize a document by describing it in terms of a small number of \"topics\". The resulting descriptions can then be used for several purposes, for example, to judge similarity between documents and to cluster together similar documents, or for document classification. This notebook covers topic modelling and in particular one method used to do topic modelling, *latent dirichlet allocation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen, in the bag-of-words model a document is represented by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the words that appear in it, and \n",
    "2. the frequency with which each word appears\n",
    "\n",
    "When a number of documents are collected into a corpus, we start by identifying *all* the words that are used by the documents in the corpus -- the \"vocabulary\" of the corpus. Each document can then be thought of as a (often very) long vector of frequencies (as long as the vocabulary), many of which will be zero. These vectors, stacked upon each other, one per document, give us the document-term matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"wideness\" of the document-term matrix poses a challenge to efficient further analysis, such as clustering and classification. So, we might ask whether we can reduce the dimensionality of the problem by summarizing each document in some way that preserves most of the information contained in the vector of word frequencies, but that makes subsequent analysis easier and more efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is what topic modelling does. In a nutshell, it summarizes documents by describing them in terms of a smaller number of topics. Over and above improving the efficency with which further analyses can be done, the resulting summaries contain useful information about what a document is \"about\".\n",

    "In this notebook we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look at how a topic model attempts to \"summarize\" the document-term matrix, using a spreadsheet example. Along the way we'll introduce a number of methods for doing topic modelling, and also some fundamental modelling \"building blocks\" like maximum likelihood.\n",
    "2. Describe Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a popular method for doing topic modeling that avoids some of the pitfalls of other methods.\n",
    "3. Show how you can do topic modelling with LDA using the **topicmodelling** package, with further analysis done in **tidytext**. We'll create a topic model for a collection of movie reviews.\n",

The unigram model assumes that all documents are generated by the same probability distribution, so $p(w_{i1})=p(w_{i2})=\\dots=p(w_{iN})$ and we can just drop the $j$ subscript and refer to $p(w_i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multinomial distribution is the appropriate distribution to use in this context, where we are sampling from a discrete distribution with $n$ classes. The parameter vector of the multinomial distribution is the vector of probabilities $[p(w_1),\\dots,p(w_n)]$. \n",

    "Here we say that, rather than there just being a single distribution over words, there are several possible distributions. Each possible distribution can be thought of as a \"topic\". Put this way, a \"topic\" is a probability distribution over words - in fact this makes quite a lot of sense (with some topics, some words are more likely to come up).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. When we generate a document, we first choose a topic from a set of $K$ topics (we have to set $K$ beforehand). The probability of choosing topic $k$ is $p(z_k)$.\n",
    "2. We then generate the words in that document from the appropriate distribution. Previously we had a single word distribution with terms like $p(w_i)$. Now we have one distribution for each topic, and the terms are $p(w_i|z=k)$. We read this as \"the probability that topic $k$ generates word $i$.  \n",

    "Say we have three words in our vocabulary $w_1$, $w_2$, $w_3$. The probability that, in a document of 6 words, word 1 appears four times, word 2 twice, and word 3 not all is, now depends on what \"topic\" the document belongs to:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Each document is a mixture of topics**. For example, a document could consist of 90% topic 1 and 10% topic 2, while another document could have different proportions of the two topics.\n",
    "2. **Each topic is a mixture of words**. This mixture, expressed as a probability distribution defined over the words in a vocabulary, can be thought of as the propensity of the topic to use certain words over others. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second of these is as for the mixture of unigrams model, but the first is new, and important - because most documents are not about just one topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A handy way of thinking of pLSA is to think of how it can be used to generate a document, assuming you know the distribution of topics for the document, and probabilities of generating different words conditional on each topic (of course, in reality finding these distributions is the problem that pLSA is trying to solve!).\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a document we would:\n",
    "1. Start with a number of words you want to generate (say 100)\n",
    "2. Divide up those \"placeholders\" for words between topics, in the specified proportions. Say, for example, we want a document with 80% topic 1 and 20% topic 2. 80 of the 100 words will come from topic 1, 20 from topic 2.\n",
    "3. Draw 80 words from the conditional probability distribution giving the probability of word *i* appearing given topic 1. \n",
    "4. Draw 20 words from the conditional probability distribution giving the probability of word *i* appearing given topic 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some more details\n",
    "\n",
    "Things get a bit hairy here, so I'll just give a sketch. \n",

    "$$p(w_{ij}) = \\sum_{k=1}^K p(w_i|z_k)p(z_k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic probabilities are the same for all documents. Put another way, documents are not allowed to be different mixtures of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pLSA model relaxes this assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(w_{ij}) = \\sum_{k=1}^K p(w_i,d_j|z_k)p(z_k|d_j)p(d_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to formulate a likelihood function that can be maximized, pLSA needs to respect some probability rules. Specifically, to work out the joint probability that a document $j$ produces a word $i$ the following \"ingredients\" are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The probability of word i given topic k, for all i and k. This is the same as before, and gives $nK$ parameters to estimate.\n",
    "* The \"mixture\" of topics in each document -- the probability that document $j$ generates topic $k$. This is new, and gives $NK$ parameters to estimate.\n",
    "* The probability that the corpus generates document $j$. This is also new, and gives $N$ parameters to estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last of these in particular is tricky conceptually, but it is needed to make sure the probabilities actually come out as probabilities -- that, for example, they sum to one. "

LDA says that the topic distributions are drawn from *another* distribution (!), specifically a Dirichlet distribution with parameters $[a_1,\\dots,a_K]$. The Dirichlet distribution is a useful distribution for modelling things like proportions and probabilities that sum to one. This means that we only estimate the $K$ parameters of the Dirichlet, substantially less than the $nK$ parameters estimated by pLSA. This also does away with the need to specifically estimate the probability that the corpus generates document $j$. These are the two main benefits of LDA over pLSA.\n",

    "This visualization shows use the most frequent words used by each topic, and this gives us a way of understanding what the topics are about. The words used by Topic 1 are mostly to do with *Waterworld* (the movie title, actors' names, some plot elements like \"mariner\", \"land\", etc). The words used by Topic 2 are mostly about *Taxi Driver*. So, the topic model is clearly picking up that the reviews are largely about two \"topics\", and that these topics relate to the movies being reviewed. Also note that some words (like \"movie\" and \"film\") are common to both topics. This is a benefit of LDA: words can be associated with more than one topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A different way of drawing out the differences between topics is to look at which words have the greatest *difference* in beta values between Topic 1 and Topic 2. This could be done in several ways but a good default is to take the advice in TMR anduse the log (base 2) ratio of the two betas: $log2(\\beta_2/\\beta_1)$. Any log ratio is symmetrical: the log ratio for $\\beta_2/\\beta_1$ is -1 times the log ratio for $\\beta_1/\\beta_2$. A base of 2 in the log ratio makes things a bit easier to interpret. The log (base 2) ratio increases by 1 for every doubling of $\\beta_2$ (relative to $\\beta_1$) leads to an increase in the log ratio of 1. \n",

    "We calculate the log ratios below and plot the words with the biggest positive and negative log ratios. We first filter out common words, such as those that have a beta greater than 1/1000 in at least one topic."
