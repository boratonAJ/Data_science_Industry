    "Working with text can be difficult. Often data collected as text is unstructured, of variable length, and prone to differences in how it is collected. You can therefore expect to do rather more cleaning of text data before it is in a shape that is useful for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a minimal introduction to working with text using the **stringr** package, which has a lot of useful helpful functions for working with text. We also look at \"regular expressions\", a language for matching patterns in text that forms the basis for many of the functions in **stringr**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn about writing strings, \"escaping\" certain characters with the backspace, and some basic functions like case conversion and string concatenation.\n",
    "2. Learn the basics of regular expressions, a powerful tool for matching patterns in strings.\n",
    "3. See how regular expressions can be used together with various **stringr** functions to do a number of useful things:\n",
    "    + detect which strings match a pattern\n",
    "    + extract the part of a string that matches a pattern\n",
    "    + replace the matched part of a string with a new string\n",

    "For further reading, I strongly recommend [this chapter](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html) in R4DS, which covers the **stringr** package in quite a bit more detail than I do here. If you are new to regular expressions, there are a number of excellent tutorials online. Start with [this one](https://regexone.com/), and further information is [here](http://www.python-course.eu/re.php) and [here](http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html). There are many good \"cheatsheets\" to help you as you go, for example [Pete Freitag's](http://www.petefreitag.com/cheatsheets/regex/). The bible of regular expressions is apparently [this book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0596528124/), if you really want to get into it!\n"

    "> Note! **stringr** has very useful functions `str_view()` and `str_view_all()` that allow you to view a HTML rendering of a pattern matched by a regular expression. This would show the whole string, with a grey block indicating the match. Unfortunately, these functions don't work in jupyter notebook, so I've used `str_extract()` and `str_extract_all()` below. These functions don't do the same thing as `str_view()`: they just *extract* the matched part of the string. This is much less illustrative of what's going on, so I suggest you rather do this next section in R, and replace `str_extract()` with `str_view()` (I've already done this in the .Rmd file [here](https://github.com/iandurbach/datasci-fi)) "
